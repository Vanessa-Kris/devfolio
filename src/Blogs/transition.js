        In December 2019, I had just relocated to Cameroon, leaving my school
        and everything behind in an attempt to start anew. At that time, I had
        absolutely no idea about my passions or what I wanted to pursue. I found
        myself amidst a mid-life crisis and numerous uncertainties.

        For nearly two years, I remained idle at home until 2021. It was during
        this period that I had a very close friend who happened to be a
        developer (and still is). I became increasingly intrigued and curious
        about the field. I began watching YouTube tutorials and coding alongside
        my friend, utilizing the old laptop they had lent me. My journey began
        with HTML.

        Around July 2021, I came across Outreachy, which offered a paid remote
        internship opportunity. I saw it as the perfect chance to get myself
        into the tech industry. Although I was scared, I was resolute in my
        determination to pursue this path.

        Transitioning into the tech field had its own set of challenges,
        including access to learning resources, consistent electricity, and
        covering internet bills. However, I firmly believed that there is always
        a solution or workaround to every problem.
